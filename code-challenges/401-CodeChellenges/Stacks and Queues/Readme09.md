### Summery:

Create a Stack and Queue class with its properties and methods with its tests.


### Challenge 

Create a Stack and Queue class with its properties and methods with its tests.

### Approach & Efficiency
1. Create Node and Stack and Queue class with a methods and its tests.
2. Because its the more simple and logic for the linked list.
3. Big O: 
   - Time: O(n)
   - Space: O(n)


### API

1.Create Node class .
2.Create Stack class with its methods:
3.push method to add node to the stack.
4.pop method to remove nodes from the top of the stack.
5.peek method to track the last value of the stack.
6.Create Queue class with its methods:
7.enqueue method to add nodes to the queue.
8.dequeue method to remove nodes from the queue.
9.peek method to track the last value of the queue.
