# Code Chellenge 26

### Summery:

Create class for node, Linked list and Hashtree with its methods.

### Challenge 

Create class for node, Linked list and Hashtree with its methods.


### Approach & Efficiency
1. Create class for node, Linked list and Hashtree with its methods.
2. Because its the more simple and logic for the linked list.
3. Big O: 

* hash function: 

   - Time: O(1)
   - Space: O(1)

* add function: 

   - Time: O(1)
   - Space: O(1)


* get function: 

   - Time: O(n)
   - Space: O(1)


* contains function: 

   - Time: O(1)
   - Space: O(1)


### API

1- add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
2- get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
3- contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
4- hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
