# Code Chellenge 28

### Summery:

function called Quick Sort that sort the array from smallest to largest element in the array by picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.

### Challenge 

1. function called Quick Sort that sort the array from smallest to largest element in the array by picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot
### Approach & Efficiency
1. function called Quick Sort that sort the array from smallest to largest element in the array by picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot
2. Because its the more simple and logic for the linked list.
3. Big O: 
   - Time: O(nLogn)

   - Space: O(nLogn)


### API

1. pick first element as pivot.
2. pick last element as pivot (implemented below).
3. Pick a random element as pivot.
4. Pick median as pivot.
