### Summery:

Create a linked list class with its properties and methods with its tests.


### Challenge 

Write a function called zipLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. 

### Approach & Efficiency
1. Create Node and Linked List class with a methods and its tests.
2. Because its the more simple and logic for the linked list.
3. Big O: 
   - Time: O(n)
   - Space: O(n)


### API

1. Create a two linked list contain the value of the node and its next node which is null.
2. Assign the linked lists to values.
3. Check the two lists and add the node from first list next to node from the second list.
4. Return them as string list.
