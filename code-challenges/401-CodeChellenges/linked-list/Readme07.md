# Code Chellenge 7

### Summery:

Create a linked list class with its properties and methods with its tests.


### Challenge 

1. method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list. 

### Approach & Efficiency
1. Create Node and Linked List class with 3 methods and its tests.
2. Because its the more simple and logic for the linked list.
3. Big O: 
   - Time: O(n)
   - Space: O(n)


### API

1. Create KTII From Lad method.
2. Med numberk, as a parameter.  
3. Return out of the range if the size out the entered size neider's value that is k from the end 10 kedlist.  
4. You have access to the Nade class and all the properties on anked List class.
