# Code Chellenge 6

### Summery:

Create a linked list class with its properties and methods with its tests.


### Challenge 

1. append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list.
2. insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node.
3. insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node.


### Approach & Efficiency
1. Create Node and Linked List class with 3 methods and its tests.
2. Because its the more simple and logic for the linked list.
3. Big O: 
   - Time: O(1)
   - Space: O(n)


### API

1. Create a Node class contain the value of the node and its next node which is null.
2. Create linked list class with head value to can be add the nodes to the head of the list.
3. Create includes method that search for a specific node value and return true if its exixts or false if its not exists.
4. Create append method to add the node after the head.
5. Create Insertbefore method to add the node before a specific node.
6. Create Insertafter method to add the node after a specific node.
