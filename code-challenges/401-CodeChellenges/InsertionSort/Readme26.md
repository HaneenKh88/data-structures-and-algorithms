# Code Chellenge 26

### Summery:

function called Insertion Sort that sort the array from smallest to largest element in the array.


### Challenge 

1.function called Insertion Sort that sort the array from smallest to largest element in the array.


### Approach & Efficiency
1. function called Insertion Sort that sort the array from smallest to largest element in the array.
2. Because its the more simple and logic for the linked list.
3. Big O: 
   - Time: O(2^n)
   - Space: O(1)


### API

1. traverses the array multiple times as it slowly builds out the sorting sequence.

2. The traversal keeps track of the minimum value and places it in the front of the array which should be incrementally sorted.
