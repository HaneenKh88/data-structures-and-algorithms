### Summery:

Connect a Stack class to Pseudo Queue class with its properties and methods with its tests.


### Challenge 

Create Pseudo Queue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this Pseudo Queue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects.

### Approach & Efficiency
1. Create Node and Stack and Pseudo Queue class with a methods and its tests.
2. Because its the more simple and logic for the linked list.
3. Big O: 
   - Time: O(n)
   - Space: O(n)


### API

1. Connect Stack class with its methods.
2. Create Stack class with its methods.
3. Enqueue method which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
4. Dequeue method which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
