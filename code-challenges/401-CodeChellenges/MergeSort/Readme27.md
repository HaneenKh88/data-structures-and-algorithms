### Summery:

function called Merge Sort that sort the array from smallest to largest element in the array by marging.

### Challenge 

1. function called Merge Sort that sort the array from smallest to largest element in the array by marging.

### Approach & Efficiency
1. function called Merge Sort that sort the array from smallest to largest element in the array by marging.
2. Because its the more simple and logic for the linked list.
3. Big O: 
   - Time: O(2^n)
   - Space: O(1)


### API

1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each comprising 1 element.

2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce newly sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
