# Code Chellenge 16

### Summery:

Create a Binary Tree class with its properties and methods with its tests.


### Challenge 

1.Method called find-maximum-value that return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.


### Approach & Efficiency
1. Method called find-maximum-value that return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.
2. Because its the more simple and logic for the linked list.
3. Big O: 
   - Time: O(n)
   - Space: O(h)


### API

1.Check If the tree is empty or not.
2.Create an array and push to it the Pre Order method array.
3.Declare Max valut thats take the root of the tree.
4.Looing on the array and assign the max value when be grater than the current value.
5.Return the max value.
