# Code Chellenge 17

### Summery:

Create a Binary Tree class with its properties and methods with its tests.


### Challenge 

1.Method called breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.



### Approach & Efficiency
1. Method called breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.
2. Because its the more simple and logic for the linked list.
3. Big O: 
   - Time: O(n)
   - Space: O(h)


### API

1. Check If the tree is empty or not.
2. Create two array one to push the current node childes and the second to push the nodes after sort it.
3. change current to the next item in the array and add its left and right children to the end of the array
4. Return the result array.
