# Code Chellenge 6

### Summery:

Create a Binary Tree class with its properties and methods with its tests.


### Challenge 

1. Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
2. Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
3. Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

### Approach & Efficiency
1. Create Node and Linked List class with 3 methods and its tests.
2. Because its the more simple and logic for the linked list.
3. Big O: 
   - Time: O(n)
   - Space: O(n)


### API

1. Create a Node class contain the value of the node and its left and right node.
2. Create Binary Tree class with Root value to can be add the first nodes to the root of the tree.
3. Create add method that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
4. Create contains method that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
